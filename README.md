## Overview

SnackSmart is a web application built with Gradio and the Gemini AI model to help you make healthier snacking choices based on your current mood. Feeling stressed? Craving something sweet? Just woke up? Tell SnackSmart how you're feeling, and it will suggest three simple and healthy snack ideas to improve your mood and control cravings.

## Features

* **Mood-Based Snack Suggestions:** Select your current mood from a dropdown, and Gemini AI will provide tailored healthy snack recommendations.
* **Surprise Me:** Get a random mood selected for you and discover new snack ideas.
* **Snack of the Day:** Receive a daily healthy snack suggestion based on a randomly chosen mood.
* **Tip of the Day:** Get a daily insightful tip related to healthy snacking.
* **Healthy Habit:** Learn a new healthy habit to incorporate into your daily routine.
* **Simple and Friendly Interface:** Built with Gradio for an easy and intuitive user experience.
